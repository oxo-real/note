# secure use of mailcap
## https://neomutt.org/guide/mimesupport#3-2-%C2%A0secure-use-of-mailcap
The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME parameters
can lead to security problems in general.
Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting.
Don't quote them with single or double quotes.
Don't put them into backtick expansions.
If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need quoting or
backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable and reference the
shell variable where necessary, as in the following example (using $charset
inside the backtick expansion is safe, since it is not itself subject to any
further expansion):

text/test-mailcap-bug; cat %s; \
copiousoutput; \
test=charset=%{charset} \
&& test "`echo $charset | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" != iso-8859-1
