User scripts are programs which make on-the-fly changes to specific web pages, typically to change their appearance or to add or modify functionality.

User scripts for Greasemonkey and Greasemonkey-compatible alternatives are written in JavaScript. If you would like to write user scripts yourself, see Greasemonkey Manual:Editing.
