[GitHub - fwupd/fwupd: A system daemon to allow session software to update firmware](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd)

Basic usage flow (command line)
If you have a device with firmware supported by fwupd, this is how you will check for updates and apply them using fwupd's command line tools.

# fwupdmgr get-devices

This will display all devices detected by fwupd.

# fwupdmgr refresh

This will download the latest metadata from LVFS.

# fwupdmgr get-updates

If updates are available for any devices on the system, they'll be displayed.

# fwupdmgr update

This will download and apply all updates for your system.

Updates that can be applied live will be done immediately.
Updates that run at bootup will be staged for the next reboot.
You can find more information about the update workflow in the end users section of the fwupd website.
