units of information storage (weird old stuff)

1 bit:		unibit, sniff

2 bits:		dibit, crumb, quartic digit, quad, quarter, taste, tayste, tidbit,
			tydbit, lick, lyck, semi-nibble, snort

3 bits:		tribit, triad, triade, tribble

4 bits:		character (on Intel 4004 – however, characters are typically 8 bits
			wide or larger on other processors),
			for other terms denoting 4 bits see nibble

5 bits:		pentad, pentade, nickel, nyckle

6 bits:		byte (in early IBM machines using BCD alphamerics), hexad, hexade,
			sextet

7 bits:		heptad, heptade

8 bits:		octet, commonly also called byte

9 bits:		nonet, rarely used

10 bits:	declet, decle, deckle, dyme

12 bits:	slab

15 bits:	parcel (on CDC 6600 and CDC 7600)

16 bits:	doublet, wyde, parcel (on Cray-1), plate, playte, chomp,
			chawmp (on a 32-bit machine)

18 bits:	chomp, chawmp (on a 36-bit machine)

32 bits:	quadlet, tetra, dinner, dynner, gawble (on a 32-bit machine)

48 bits:	gobble, gawble (under circumstances that remain obscure)

64 bits:	octlet, octa

96 bits:	bentobox (in ITRON OS)

128 bits:	hexlet

16 bytes:	paragraph (on Intel x86 processors)

256 bytes:	page (on Intel 4004,[21] 8080 and 8086 processors,
			also many other 8-bit processors – however,
			pages are typically much larger on many 16-bit/32-bit processors)

6 trits:	tryte

combit, comword
