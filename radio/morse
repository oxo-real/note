The basic element of Morse code is the dot.
All other elements can be defined in terms of multiples of the dot length.
The word PARIS has a total length of 50 dot lengths.

Paris
.--. .- .-. .. ...


If the word PARIS can be sent ten times in a minute using normal Morse code timing then the code speed is 10 WPM.

The character speed is related to dot length in seconds by the following formula:

Speed (WPM) = 2.4 * (Dots per second)



Here are the ratios for the other code elements:

Dash length

Dot length x 3

Pause between elements

Dot length

Pause between characters

Dot length x 3

Pause between words (see note)

Dot length x 7



Note: For learning the code this ratio is often increased so that overall text speed is lower than in standard Morse code. This stretched code is called Farnsworth code.
