# tier 1 local backup

## risk
operational data malformations mainly due to human error

## form
a mirror on the same storage device

## execution
### rsync share c to b
% sudo chattr -R -i $XDG_DATA_HOME/b && \
% rsync -aAXv --delete --info=progress2 $XDG_DATA_HOME/c/ $XDG_DATA_HOME/b && \
% sudo chattr -R +i $XDG_DATA_HOME/b


# tier 2 remote backup

## risk
second line of defence against tier 1 risks and:
catastrofic hardware failure

## form
separate storage device within the main operating environment

## execution
syncr

# tier 3 off-site backup

## goal
protect against tier 1, tier 2 risks and:
protection against hardware failure due to physical violence
i.e. hardware failure due to fire, water into the main operating environment

tier 3 online
internet

tier 3 offline
separate storage device on separate storage location
