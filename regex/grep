# -E, --extended-regexp
grep -E '<regex>'

-E, --extended-regexp
	   Interpret   PATTERNS    as    extended    regular
       expressions (EREs, see below).

-F, --fixed-strings
       Interpret  PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular
       expressions.

-G, --basic-regexp
       Interpret PATTERNS as basic  regular  expressions
       (BREs, see below).  This is the default.

-P, --perl-regexp
       Interpret  PATTERNS  as  Perl-compatible  regular
       expressions (PCREs).  This option is experimental
       when  combined  with the -z (--null-data) option,
       and grep -P may warn of unimplemented features.

-e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS
       Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option  is
       used  multiple  times  or is combined with the -f
       (--file) option, search for all  patterns  given.
       This  option  can  be  used  to protect a pattern
       beginning with "-".

-f FILE, --file=FILE
       Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this
       option is used multiple times or is combined with
       the -e (--regexp) option, search for all patterns
       given.   The  empty  file contains zero patterns,
       and therefore matches nothing.

-w, --word-regexp
       Select  only  those lines containing matches that
       form whole words.  The test is that the  matching
       substring  must either be at the beginning of the
       line,  or  preceded  by  a  non-word  constituent
       character.   Similarly,  it must be either at the
       end  of  the  line  or  followed  by  a  non-word
       constituent      character.      Word-constituent
       characters   are   letters,   digits,   and   the
       underscore.   This  option has no effect if -x is
       also specified.

-x, --line-regexp
       Select only those matches that exactly match  the
       whole  line.   For  a regular expression pattern,
       this is like parenthesizing the pattern and  then
       surrounding it with ^ and $.
