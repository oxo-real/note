It’s possible to manually configure WireGuard on Linux using third-party clients. In this guide, we’ll show you how to configure WireGuard on any Linux distribution using the official WireGuard(new window) CLI tool for Linux, and on Debian and Ubuntu-based systems using NetworkManager.

An advantage of manually configuring WireGuard on Linux is that our WireGuard config files support port forwarding.

How to manually configure WireGuard on Linux
1. Install(new window) the official WireGuard VPN CLI tool for your distribution.

2. Sign in to account.protonvpn.com, go to Downloads → WireGuard configuration, and download a WireGuard configuration file. Note that WireGuard can be picky about the length of .conf names, so please ensure the the downloaded .conf file name is under 15 characters (you may need to rename the default suggested name to achieve this).

3. Move the downloaded .conf configuration file to the /etc/wireguard/ directory.

4. In a terminal window, enter:

sudo wg-quick up [the name of the configuration file, excluding the .conf suffix]
For example, if your configuration file is named swiss1-CH-5.conf, enter:

sudo wg-quick up swiss1-CH-5

Your privacy is now protected by Proton VPN! To verify that the connection is running, enter:

sudo wg
You can also visit ip.me(new window) to confirm that everything is working correctly.


To end the VPN session, enter:

sudo wg-quick down [the name of the configuration file, excluding the .conf suffix]
For example:

sudo wg-quick down swiss1-CH-5
