ProtonVPN command-line tool for Linux
We have updated our Linux VPN command-line tool! These instructions are for version 2.0 of our Linux client.

Link to the GitHub repository – https://github.com/ProtonVPN/linux-cli

For more extensive information about the features and how to use the VPN client, read the Usage Guide.

You will need the latest updates of the following dependencies installed on your Linux repository:

openvpn
python3.5+
dialog (optional, needed for interactive selection)
pip for python3 (pip3)
Instructions for installing these packages on different distributions:
On Archlinux/ Manjaro, please use:
sudo pacman -S openvpn dialog python-pip python-setuptools

sudo pip3 install protonvpn-cli

Make sure to run pip as sudo, so it installs globally and recognizes the command with sudo

On SUSE, please use:
sudo zypper in -y openvpn dialog python3-pip python3-setuptools

sudo pip3 install protonvpn-cli

On Fedora / CentOS / RHEL, please use:
sudo dnf install -y openvpn dialog python3-pip python3-setuptools

sudo pip3 install protonvpn-cli

On Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint and other derivatives, please use:
sudo apt install -y openvpn dialog python3-pip python3-setuptools

sudo pip3 install protonvpn-cli

Manual installation from source

To perform a manual installation from source, visit the ProtonVPN Linux client project page on GitHub.

Initialization
Once you have installed the client, you will need to initialize your ProtonVPN profile so you can connect it to a VPN server. You can do this by using the sudo protonvpn init command. This will bring up the screen below.



When you are asked for your Username and Password on this screen, it is referring to your OpenVPN credentials, not your ProtonVPN login credentials.

Learn how to find your OpenVPN credentials.

Kill Switch
ProtonVPN-CLI has a built-in Kill Switch that protects your data in case your VPN connection is interrupted or cut unexpectedly.

Enabling Kill Switch

To enable Kill Switch, open the configuration menu with protonvpn configure, then select 5 for Kill Switch and confirm the activation with either 1 or 2, depending on your preference.

1 will block access from your directly connected network (e.g. public WiFi) and is recommended for laptops that may connect to untrusted networks.

2 will allow access from your directly connected network and is for computers that don’t leave a secure and trusted LAN, like your home network.

On the next connection Kill Switch will be enabled.

Update
We will periodically update the ProtonVPN-CLI to deal with bugs or to introduce new features.

The command to update ProtonVPN-CLI is: sudo pip3 install protonvpn-cli --upgrade.

Uninstall
If you want to uninstall ProtonVPN-CLI, run configure first and purge the configuration. Then uninstall through the package manager you used for installation.

For PIP this would be:

sudo pip3 uninstall protonvpn-cli
