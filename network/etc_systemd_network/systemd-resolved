```
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved.service
```

systemd-resolved has four modes for handling the Domain name resolution
(the four modes are described in systemd-resolved(8)).

one of them is using the systemd DNS stub file:

/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

this file contains:
- the local stub 127.0.0.53 as the only DNS server and
- a list of search domains.

This is the recommended mode of operation.
The service users are advised to redirect the /etc/resolv.conf file to the local
stub DNS resolver file /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf managed by
systemd-resolved.
This propagates the systemd managed configuration to all the clients.
This can be done by replacing /etc/resolv.conf with a symbolic link to the
systemd stub:

```
# ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

check if dns is used by systemd-resolved:

```
resolvectl status
```

## set dns server automatically
systemd-resolved will work out of the box with a network manager using /etc/resolv.conf.
No particular configuration is required since systemd-resolved will be detected
by following the /etc/resolv.conf symlink. This is going to be the case with
systemd-networkd or NetworkManager.

if the DHCP and VPN clients use the resolvconf program to set name servers and
search domains (see openresolv#Users for a list of software that use resolvconf),
the additional package systemd-resolvconf is needed to provide the /usr/bin/resolvconf symlink.
## set dns server manually
In local DNS stub mode, custom DNS server(s) can be set in the resolved.conf(5) file:

/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_servers.conf
```
[Resolve]
DNS=192.168.3.1
Domains=~.
```

DNS over TLS is disabled by default. To enable it change the DNSOverTLS= setting
in the [Resolve] section in resolved.conf(5). To enable validation of your DNS
provider's server certificate, include their hostname in the DNS= setting in
the format ip_address#hostname. For example:

/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_over_tls.conf
```
[Resolve]
DNS=9.9.9.9#dns.quad9.net
DNSOverTLS=yes
```
Note: The DNS server used must support DNS over TLS. Otherwise all DNS requests will fail.
