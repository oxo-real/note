Installation
Install the fprintd package. imagemagick might also be needed.

Some devices require a different fork of libfprint specifically made for touch-based sensors and not (yet?) merged with the main libfprint: libfprint-tod. This is available as libfprint-tod-gitAUR

Configuration
Login configuration
Note:
If you use GDM, the fingerprint-option is already available in the login menu (if not add yourself to the input group). You can skip this section!
If you use SDDM, see SDDM#Using a fingerprint reader.
Add pam_fprintd.so as sufficient to the top of the auth section of /etc/pam.d/system-local-login:

/etc/pam.d/system-local-login
auth      sufficient pam_fprintd.so
auth      include   system-login
...
This tries to use fingerprint login first, and if it fails or if it finds no fingerprint signatures in the given user's home directory, it proceeds to password login.

You can also modify other files in /etc/pam.d/{login,su,sudo,gdm,lightdm} in the same way, for example /etc/pam.d/polkit-1 for GNOME polkit authentication or /etc/pam.d/kde to unlock KDE's lockscreen.

Adding pam_fprintd.so as sufficient to any configuration file in /etc/pam.d/ when a fingerprint signature is present will only prompt for fingerprint authentication. This prevents the use of a password if you cannot Ctrl+c fingerprint authentication (due to the lack of a shell). In order to use either a password or a fingerprint in a graphical interface, add the following line to the top of any files required:

auth		sufficient  	pam_unix.so try_first_pass likeauth nullok
auth		sufficient  	pam_fprintd.so
...
This will prompt for a password; pressing Enter on a blank field will proceed to fingerprint authentication.

If you want to prompt for fingerprint and password input at the same time, you can use pam-fprint-grosshackAUR. This may be needed for some graphical programs which do not allow blank password input, such as Gnome's built-in polkit agent. To use this package, add the following lines to the top of any files required:

auth		sufficient  	pam_fprintd_grosshack.so
auth		sufficient  	pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok
...
Create fingerprint signature
You will need to have an authentication agent running before being able to enroll.

To add a signature for a finger, run:

$ fprintd-enroll
or create a new signature for all fingers:

$ fprintd-delete "$USER"
$ for finger in {left,right}-{thumb,{index,middle,ring,little}-finger}; do fprintd-enroll -f "$finger" "$USER"; done
You will be asked to scan the given finger. Swipe your right index finger five times. After that, the signature is created in /var/lib/fprint/.
