gpg: keyserver receive failed: General error
problem importing keys

## solution
use different keyserver
most common keyservers are:

https://sks-keyservers.net/
SKS Keyserver Pool: federated, no verification, keys cannot be deleted.
https://keys.mailvelope.com/
Mailvelope Keyserver: central, verification of email IDs, keys can be deleted.
https://keys.openpgp.org/
keys.openpgp.org: central, verification of email IDs, keys can be deleted, no third-party signatures (i.e. no Web of Trust support).
More are listed at Wikipedia:Key server (cryptographic)#Keyserver examples.
(https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#Use_a_keyserver)

## permanent solution
An alternative key server can be specified
with the keyserver option in one of the #Configuration files, for instance:

vim ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf
keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net

## temporary solution
A temporary use of another server is handy when the regular one does not work as it should.
It can be achieved by;
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org/ --search-keys 931FF8E79F0876134EDDBDCCA87FF9DF48BF1C90
or, receive directly:
gpg --recv-keys 7DCB12A7
