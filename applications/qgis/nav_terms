# heading (hdg)

heading: direction of aim in relation to north

where the nose of the airplane or bow of the vessel is pointing


# course (crs)

course: actual direction of movement in relation to north

crosswind = 0 --> heading = course


# true bearing (brg)

reference point is geographical north

bearing: angle between geographical north and the direction of destination


# magnetic bearing (brgm)

angle between magnetic north and the direction of destination

reference point is magnetic north
most relevant for navigation and for others looking to find you
with to fixed object bearings you can triangulate your position


# relative bearing (brgr)

(navigational bearing)

angle between heading and destination
reference point is heading
0 degrees if heading = course

a lookout on a boat always directs a relative bearing
bow of the vessel == 0 degrees
aft of the vessel == 180 degrees

most relevant to the crew of the boat


# track (trk)
track: actual course history


# formulas

true bearing = heading + relative bearing
brg=hdg+brgr

geographical north + declination = magnetic north
