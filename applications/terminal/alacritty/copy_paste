# Alacritty's vi mode
(default) Ctrl+Shift+Space

## copy_paste

The vi mode allows moving around Alacritty's viewport and scrollback using the keyboard.
By default you can toggle it using Ctrl+Shift+Space.
To copy, you can either use a mouse to select and press Ctrl+Shift+c,
or enter Vi mode, start a selection using v,
move around with hjkl like in vim, and copy the selection with y.
To paste, press Ctrl+Shift+v.

Don't know yet what to cause of this behaviour is.

As a mitigation press backspace after using the paste command or keystroke (C-S-c)

"Wayland is used by default on systems that support it. Using XWayland may circumvent Wayland specific issues and can be enabled through:

env WINIT_UNIX_BACKEND=x11 alacritty"
