after manual colorchange via execution of a base16 symlink i.e.

base16_irblack

base16 writes .vimrc_background

to keep vim current

it does that by executing the underlying shell script
because base16_irblack is an alias:

base16_irblack='_base16 "/home/cytopyge/.config/base16-shell/scripts/base16-irblack.sh" irblack'

? where does base16 has the location of the .vimrc_background? I want to change it
