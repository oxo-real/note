# download a package without installing
pacman -Sw package_name

# install a 'local' package that is not from a remote repository (e.g. the package is from the AUR):
pacman -U /path/to/package/package_name-version.pkg.tar.xz

# keep a copy of the local package in pacman's cache, use:
pacman -U file:///path/to/package/package_name-version.pkg.tar.xz

# install a 'remote' package (not from a repository stated in pacman's configuration files):

pacman -U http://www.example.com/repo/example.pkg.tar.xz

To inhibit the -S, -U and -R actions, -p can be used.

Pacman always lists packages to be installed or removed and asks for permission before it takes action.
