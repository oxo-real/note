if you removed packages from the package database, but the files failed to be
removed (i.e. because there where no write permissions), you will see this:

# error

% yay -Rns ssss
[sudo] password for cytopyge:

Packages (1) ssss-0.5-4

Total Removed Size:  0.07 MiB

# problem:
the package database is no longer congruent with the package files

# solution:
remove package files, to become up to date with the database again

## automatic
you can use cytopyges script: ~/_git/notes/applications/yay/conflicting_packages for this

## manual
if you run cytopyges updater you can get affected packages from logging:

cd $HOME/_data/journal/logs/$HOST/updater/package_lists

retrieve package name from newest logfile of diffs (_dQ)
(find the newest file with cytopyge's tool get_newest)

or

from the package_list file before update (_0Q)
