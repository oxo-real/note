[man i3blocks (1): A flexible scheduler for your i3bar blocks](https://manpages.org/i3blocks#options)

The standard output of the command line is used to update the block content. Each non-empty line of the output will overwrite the corresponding property:

1.
full_text
2.
short_text
3.
color
For example, this script sets the full_text in blue but no short_text:

echo "Here's my label"
echo
echo \#0000FF

If the command line returns 0 or 33, the block is updated. Otherwise, it is considered a failure and the first line (if any) is still displayed. Note that stderr is ignored. A return code of 33 will set the urgent flag to true.
