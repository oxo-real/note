# bits & bytes

# 0b1 = 1 bit
a binary number of one bit can be either 0 or 1
binary numbers can be written as 0b111111

# 8 bits = 1 byte
the convention is that there are 8 bits in one byte
values in computer are expressed as multiples of bytes

# 0x1 = 4 bits
one hexadecimal digit needs 4 bits in a binary expression
hexadecimal numbers can be written as 0xABCDEF

# 1 byte = 8 bits (2 hex digits)
so a byte can be expressed with two hex digits
you need 8 bits to represent 1 byte as a binary number

# table

		0	1	2	3		4		5		6

0d		1	2	4	8		16		32		64			15		26

0x		1	2	4	8		16		20		40			F		1A

0b		0	1	11	1000	10000	100000	1000000		1111	10011
