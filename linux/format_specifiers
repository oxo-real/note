Format specifiers in C
CServer Side ProgrammingProgramming
The format specifiers are used in C for input and output purposes. Using this concept the compiler can understand that what type of data is in a variable during taking input using the scanf() function and printing using printf() function. Here is a list of format specifiers.

Format Specifier	Type
%c	Character
%d	Signed integer
%e or %E	Scientific notation of floats
%f	Float values
%g or %G	Similar as %e or %E
%hi	Signed integer (short)
%hu	Unsigned Integer (short)
%i	Unsigned integer
%l or %ld or %li	Long
%lf	Double
%Lf	Long double
%lu	Unsigned int or unsigned long
%lli or %lld	Long long
%llu	Unsigned long long
%o	Octal representation
%p	Pointer
%s	String
%u	Unsigned int
%x or %X	Hexadecimal representation
%n	Prints nothing
%%	Prints % character
These are the basic format specifiers. We can add some other parts with the format specifiers. These are like below âˆ’

A minus symbol (-) sign tells left alignment

A number after % specifies the minimum field width. If string is less than the width, it will be filled with spaces

A period (.) is used to separate field width and precision
