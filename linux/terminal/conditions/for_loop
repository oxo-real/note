# bash 'static' for loop

```
for i in {1..10}
do
	printf $i
done
```

## however, with variable start and/or end values, this does not work
## in that case use three-expression bash for loops syntax:


# bash 'variable' for loop

```
start_value=1
end_value=10
for (( i=$start_value; i<=$end_value; i++ ))
do
	printf $i
done
```

## loop through files
```
for i in *.txt
do
	print $i
done
```
