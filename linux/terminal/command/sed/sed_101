sed stream editor; transforms text input line by line
## youtube: understanding how sed works (4 parts)

syntax:		sed -options 'commands' input_file


input  ==>  	pattern space (command processing) ==>  	output

			/\
			||
			\/

			hold space


# general behaviour for every input line:
1. copy current line to pattern space
2. process commands in pattern space
3. move result to output (automatic printing)
4. goto next input line

sed always runs for every line the general steps 1, 2, 3 and 4
within step 2 specific commands can be executed

the explanation below actually only zoom in at commands executed in step 2
always take all the general behaviour steps of sed into consideration
while writing or executing scripts


sample file:
1. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (first line)
2. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (second line)
3. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (third line)
4. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (fourth line)


# summary

## options
-n	no automatic printing (disable general step 3)

## commands
p	print current pattern space to output
n	print current pattern space to output and goto next input line
d	delete current pattern space, start next cycle
=	print current line number
N	read next input line into the pattern space
P	print the first line of the current pattern space
h/H	copy / append pattern space to hold space
g/G	copy / append hold space to pattern space
x	exchange the contents of hold space and pattern space
s	substitute
g	globally (work on all occurences)
I	ignore case
