# Controlling the Cursor

The capnames below output strings containing control codes that instruct the
terminal to manipulate the cursor:

##	Cursor control capnames
Capname			Description
sc				Save the cursor position
rc				Restore the cursor position
home			Move the cursor to upper left corner (0,0)
cup <row> <col>	Move the cursor to position row, col
cud1			Move the cursor down 1 line
cuu1			Move the cursor up 1 line
civis			Set to cursor to be invisible
cnorm			Set the cursor to its normal state

# Text Effects
Like the capnames used for cursor manipulation, the following capnames output
strings of control codes that affect the way our terminal displays text characters:

##	Text effects capnames
Capname			Description
bold			Start bold text
smul			Start underlined text
rmul			End underlined text
rev				Start reverse video
blink			Start blinking text
invis			Start invisible text
smso			Start “standout” mode
rmso			End “standout” mode
sgr0			Turn off all attributes
setaf <value>	Set foreground color
setab <value>	Set background color


#	Text Color
Most terminals support 8 foreground text colors and 8 background colors (though
some support as many as 256). Using the setaf and setab capabilities, we can set
the foreground and background colors. The exact rendering of colors is a little
hard to predict. Many desktop managers impose “system colors” on terminal
windows, thereby modifying foreground and background colors from the standard.
Despite this, here are what the colors should be:

##	Text colors
Value			Color
0				Black
1				Red
2				Green
3				Yellow
4				Blue
5				Magenta
6				Cyan
7				White
8				Not used
9				Reset to default color


#	Clearing the Screen
These capnames allow us to selectively clear portions of the terminal display:

##	Screen erasure capnames
Capname			Description
smcup			Save screen contents
rmcup			Restore screen contents
el				Clear from the cursor to the end of the line
el1				Clear from the cursor to the beginning of the line
ed				Clear from the cursor to the end of the screen
clear			Clear the entire screen and home the cursor
