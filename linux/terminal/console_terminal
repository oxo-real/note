# teletype (tty), teleprinter or teletypewriter

A communications device that allows operators to send and receive text-based
messages using a typewriter-style keyboard and printed paper output.
The basic principle behind teleprinters, is when two electric typewriters linked
together by wires (or a wireless radio link). Whatever you type on one typewriter
gets automatically printed out on the other.
An example is Teletype Corporation's Model 33 (1963).


# console

A Console in the context of computers is a console or cabinet with a screen and
keyboard combined inside it. But, it's effectively a Terminal. Technically the
Console is the device and the Terminal is now the software program inside the
Console.
An example is the IBM 1620 (around the year 1960).

In modern Linux the console refers to the prompt you get, after the kernel has
booted.


# terminal

A physical teletype workstation, like the widely emulated hardware computer terminal DEC VT100.

The word Terminal comes from terminate, indicating that it's the terminating end
or "terminal" end of a communications process.

When we refer to a Terminal in the software sense, we're referring to a literal
software version of a TTY or Terminal.


# shell

A shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a
human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a
command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI),
depending on a computer's role and particular operation.
It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system

Bash and Z shell (zsh) are widely adopted unix shells.

## zsh
Paul Falstad wrote the first version of Zsh in 1990[5] while a student at
Princeton University.[6] The name zsh derives from the name of Yale professor
Zhong Shao (then a teaching assistant at Princeton University) â€” Paul Falstad
regarded Shao's login-id, "zsh", as a good name for a shell.
