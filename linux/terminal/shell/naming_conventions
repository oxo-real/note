variables with underscores

filenames, commands (with their flags) and functions with dashes

why?
1. this way filenames, commands and functions are easier to type ('-' versus '_',which needs a shift)
2. distinguish variables from filenames, commands and functions

i.e.

function-example()
{
    variable_one=1
}
