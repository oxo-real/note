# Expansion
The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in five steps:

## History Expansion
This is performed only in interactive shells.

## Alias Expansion
Aliases are expanded immediately before the command line is parsed as explained
in Aliasing.

## Process Substitution

## Parameter Expansion

## Command Substitution

## Arithmetic Expansion

## Brace Expansion
These five are performed in left-to-right fashion. On each argument, any of the
five steps that are needed are performed one after the other.
Hence, for example, all the parts of parameter expansion are completed
before command substitution is started. After these expansions,
all unquoted occurrences of the characters ‘\’,‘’’ and ‘"’ are removed.

## Filename Expansion
If the SH_FILE_EXPANSION option is set, the order of expansion is modified for
compatibility with sh and ksh. In that case filename expansion is performed
immediately after alias expansion, preceding the set of five expansions mentioned above.

## Filename Generation
This expansion, commonly referred to as globbing, is always done last.
