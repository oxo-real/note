## Integer Comparison Operators

### mathematic
Operator	Description			Example
-eq		Is Equal To			if [ $1 -eq 200 ]
-ne		Is Not Equal To			if [ $1 -ne 1 ]
-gt		Is Greater Than			if [ $1 -gt 15 ]
-ge		Is Greater Than Or Equal To	if [ $1 -ge 10 ]
-lt		Is Less Than			if [ $1 -lt 5 ]
-le		Is Less Than Or Equal To	if [ $1 -le 0 ]

### lexic
Operator	Description			Example
==		Is Equal To			if (( $1 == $2 ))
!=		Is Not Equal To			if (( $1 != $2 ))
<		Is Less Than			if (( $1 < $2 ))
<=		Is Less Than Or Equal To	if (( $1 <= $2 ))
>		Is Greater Than			if (( $1 > $2 ))
>=		Is Greater Than Or Equal To	if (( $1 >= $2 ))

### difference mathematic vs. lexic
[[ 20 > 100 ]]
echo $?
0

[[ 20 -gt 100 ]]
echo $?
