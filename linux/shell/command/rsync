# standard options

## synching files to an archive
rsync -aAXv --info=ALL

## synching files to a backup
rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --delete

## aliasing rsync
alias cp='rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --human-readable --whole-file'
alias mv='rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --human-readable --whole-file --remove-source-files'


# securely sync from local device to remote location

sudo rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --files-from=<files_from_list> -e ssh \
<source:local_device_mountpoint_dir> \
<destination:{remote_user}@{remote_ip}:/{remote_target_dir}>

## --files-from-list files are relative to source directory

# important notices
SRC  = sending side
DEST = receiving side

Usages with just one SRC arg and no DEST arg will list the source files
instead of copying.

use identical file systems on SRC and DEST
different fs types on SRC and DEST devices seems to rsync get idle

## get help on info flags
rsync --info=help

## mentionable options
-u, --update
skip files that are newer on the receiver
do not copy SRC files that are older then DEST files

--delete
delete extraneous files from dest dirs
delete DEST files that are not in SRC

--remove-source-files
non-directories
delete files in SRC after copying

-W, --whole-file
This option disables rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm, which causes  all  trans‐
ferred  files  to  be  sent whole.  The transfer may be faster if this option is
used when the bandwidth between the source and destination  machines  is  higher
than  the  bandwidth to disk (especially when the "disk" is actually a networked
filesystem).  This is the default when both the source and destination are spec‐
ified as local paths, but only if no batch-writing option is in effect.

--partial
keep partially transferred files

--partial-dir=DIR
put a partially transferred file into DIR
RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment variable.
Setting  this  in the environment does not force --partial to be enabled,
but rather it affects where partial files go when --partial is specified.
recommended partial directory= $XDG_CACHE_HOME/rsync/partial

--log-file=FILE
send logs to FILE
recommended log file= $XDG_LOGS_HOME/rsync/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
