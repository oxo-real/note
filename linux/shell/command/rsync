# standard options

## synching files to an archive
rsync -aAXv --info=ALL

## synching files to a backup
rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --delete

## aliasing rsync
alias cp='rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --human-readable --whole-file'
alias mv='rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --human-readable --whole-file --remove-source-files'


# securely sync from local device to remote location

sudo rsync -aAXv --info=ALL --files-from=<files_from_list> -e ssh \
<source:local_device_mountpoint_dir> \
<destination:{remote_user}@{remote_ip}:/{remote_target_dir}>

## --files-from-list files are relative to source directory

# important notices
SRC  = sending side
DEST = receiving side

Usages with just one SRC arg and no DEST arg will list the source files
instead of copying.

use identical file systems on SRC and DEST
different fs types on SRC and DEST devices seems to rsync get idle

## get help on info flags
rsync --info=help

## mentionable options
-a, --archive
recursion with preservation like times, ownership, permissions and attributes
(no hardlinks!)

-u, --update
skip files that are newer on the receiver
do not copy SRC files that are older then DEST files

--delete
delete extraneous files from dest dirs
delete DEST files that are not in SRC

--remove-source-files
non-directories
delete files in SRC after copying

-W, --whole-file
This option disables rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm, which causes  all  trans‐
ferred  files  to  be  sent whole.  The transfer may be faster if this option is
used when the bandwidth between the source and destination  machines  is  higher
than  the  bandwidth to disk (especially when the "disk" is actually a networked
filesystem).  This is the default when both the source and destination are spec‐
ified as local paths, but only if no batch-writing option is in effect.

--partial
keep partially transferred files

--partial-dir=DIR
put a partially transferred file into DIR
RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment variable.
Setting  this  in the environment does not force --partial to be enabled,
but rather it affects where partial files go when --partial is specified.
recommended partial directory= $XDG_CACHE_HOME/rsync/partial

--log-file=FILE
send logs to FILE
recommended log file= $XDG_LOGS_HOME/rsync/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

## rsync comparison method
--------------------------------
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13778889/rsync-difference-between-size-only-and-ignore-times

The long answer is that rsync has three ways to decide if a file is outdated:

1. Compare the size of source and destination.
2. Compare the timestamp of source and destination.
3. Compare the static checksum of source and destination.

--------------------------------
dircompare
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57305/rsync-compare-directories
### files not in RIGHT, but in LEFT
rsync -rin --ignore-existing "$LEFT_DIR"/ "$RIGHT_DIR"/ |sed -e 's/^[^ ]* /L /'
### files not in LEFT, but in RIGHT
rsync -rin --ignore-existing "$RIGHT_DIR"/ "$LEFT_DIR"/ |sed -e 's/^[^ ]* /R /'
### files in LEFT different in RIGHT
rsync -rin --existing "$LEFT_DIR"/ "$RIGHT_DIR"/ |sed -e 's/^/X /'

dircompare output interpretation
L             file-only-in-Left-dir			in source, not in destination
R             file-only-in-right-dir		in destination, not in soucre
X >f.st...... file-with-dif-size-and-time
X .f...p..... file-with-dif-perms

## rsync output interpretation
--------------------------------
<filename>			in source, not in destination
deleting <filename>	in destination, not in source
--------------------------------

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57305/rsync-compare-directories
with one <filename> on a line for every "new" file in ${SOURCE}
and one "deleting <filename>" line for each "new" file in ${DEST}

These checks are performed before transferring data. Notably, this means the static checksum is distinct from the stream checksum - the later is computed while transferring data.

By default, rsync use 1 and 2. Both 1 and 2 can be acquired together by a single stat, whereas 3 requires reading the entire file (this is independent from reading the file for transfer). Assuming only one modifier is specified, that means the following:

By using --size-only, only 1 is performed - timestamps and checksum are ignored. A file is copied unless its size is identical on both ends.

By using --ignore-times, neither of 1, 2 or 3 is performed. A file is always copied.

By using --checksum, 3 is used in addition to 1 but 2 is not performed. A file is copied unless size and checksum match. The checksum is only computed if size matches.

# EXAMPLE OF OUTPUT
#------------------
# L             file-only-in-Left-dir
# R             file-only-in-right-dir
# X >f.st...... file-with-dif-size-and-time
# X .f...p..... file-with-dif-perms
#
# L / R mean that the file/dir appears only at the `L`eft or `R`ight dir.
#
# X     means that a file appears on both sides but is not the same (in which
#       case the next 11 characters give you more info. In most cases knowing
#       that s,t,T and p depict differences in Size, Time and Permissions
#       is enough but `man rsync` has more info
#       (look at the --itemize-changes option)

# OPTIONS
#---------
# All options are passed to rsync. Here are the most useful for the purpose
# of directory comparisons:
#
# -c will force comparison of file contents (otherwise only
#    time & size is compared which is much faster)
#
# -p/-o/-g will force comparison of permissions/owner/group
