using the printf function (instead of the print command) in awk

s string
n number
f float

1st printed column has 15 chars width, right aligned, padded on left with spaces
2nd printed column has 5 chars width, left aligned, padded on right with spaces

awk ' { printf("%15s %-5s %05d %s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4) }' infile


%d display integer numbers
now you are able to use zero's for padding: %05d
3nd printed column has 5 digits width, right aligned, padded on left with zeros
