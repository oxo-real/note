SHOW OPTIONS (APPLY TO -P AND --SHOW)
       -c, --complete
              Print a list of all AUR and repo packages. This allows shell completion and is
              not intended to be used directly by the user.

       -f, --fish
              During complete adjust the output for the fish shell.

       -d, --defaultconfig
              Print default yay configuration.

       -g, --currentconfig
              Print current yay configuration.

       -n, --numberupgrades
              Deprecated, use yay -Qu and wc -l instead.

       -s, --stats
              Displays information about installed packages and system health. If there are
              orphaned, or out-of-date packages, or packages that no longer exist on the AUR;
              warnings will be displayed.

       -u, --upgrades
              Deprecated, use yay -Qu instead.

       -w, --news

              newer than the build date of all native packages. Pass this twice to show all
              available news.

       -q, --quiet
              Only show titles when printing news.
