GREP_COLORS
              Controls how the --color option highlights output.  Its
              value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that
              defaults to
              ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the
              rv and ne boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).
              Supported capabilities are as follows.

              sl=    SGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e.,
                     matching lines when the -v command-line option is
                     omitted, or non-matching lines when -v is
                     specified).  If however the boolean rv capability
                     and the -v command-line option are both specified,
                     it applies to context matching lines instead.  The
                     default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default
                     color pair).

              cx=    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-
                     matching lines when the -v command-line option is
                     omitted, or matching lines when -v is specified).
                     If however the boolean rv capability and the -v
                     command-line option are both specified, it applies
                     to selected non-matching lines instead.  The
                     default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default
                     color pair).

              rv     Boolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of
                     the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v command-
                     line option is specified.  The default is false
                     (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              mt=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any
                     matching line (i.e., a selected line when the -v
                     command-line option is omitted, or a context line
                     when -v is specified).  Setting this is equivalent
                     to setting both ms= and mc= at once to the same
                     value.  The default is a bold red text foreground
                     over the current line background.

              ms=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a
                     selected line.  (This is only used when the -v
                     command-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the
                     sl= (or cx= if rv) capability remains active when
                     this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text
                     foreground over the current line background.

              mc=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a
                     context line.  (This is only used when the -v
                     command-line option is specified.)  The effect of
                     the cx= (or sl= if rv) capability remains active
                     when this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text
                     foreground over the current line background.

              fn=35  SGR substring for file names prefixing any content
                     line.  The default is a magenta text foreground
                     over the terminal's default background.

              ln=32  SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any
                     content line.  The default is a green text
                     foreground over the terminal's default background.

              bn=32  SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any
                     content line.  The default is a green text
                     foreground over the terminal's default background.

              se=36  SGR substring for separators that are inserted
                     between selected line fields (:), between context
                     line fields, (-), and between groups of adjacent
                     lines when nonzero context is specified (--).  The
                     default is a cyan text foreground over the
                     terminal's default background.

              ne     Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of
                     line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (\33[K) each
                     time a colorized item ends.  This is needed on
                     terminals on which EL is not supported.  It is
                     otherwise useful on terminals for which the
                     back_color_erase (bce) boolean terminfo capability
                     does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do
                     not affect the background, or when EL is too slow
                     or causes too much flicker.  The default is false
                     (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no =... part.  They
              are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when
              specified.

              See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the
              documentation of the text terminal that is used for
              permitted values and their meaning as character
              attributes.  These substring values are integers in
              decimal representation and can be concatenated with
              semicolons.  grep takes care of assembling the result into
              a complete SGR sequence (\33[...m).  Common values to
              concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for
              blink, 7 for inverse, 39 for default foreground color, 30
              to 37 for foreground colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color mode
              foreground colors, 38;5;0 to 38;5;255 for 88-color and
              256-color modes foreground colors, 49 for default
              background color, 40 to 47 for background colors, 100 to
              107 for 16-color mode background colors, and 48;5;0 to
              48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes background
              colors.
