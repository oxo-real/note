1. package exixts in filesystem

error: could not prepare transaction
error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
package: /path/to/file exists in filesystem
Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.

solution:
check if another package owns the file
# pacman -Qo /path/to/file
owned by another package > bugreport
not owned by another package > rename /path/to/file
re-issue the update command
if all goes well, the file may then be removed

explanation:
Every installed package provides a /var/lib/pacman/local/package-version/files
file that contains metadata about this package.
If this file gets corrupted, is empty or goes missing,
it results in file exists in filesystem errors.

you may explicitly run pacman -S --overwrite glob package
