debugfs -w /dev/sda5
clri path/to/file
run fsck

Has anyone ever gotten "structure needs cleaning" errors on their EXT4 file system?
Solved- don't use windows to copy data to an ext4. I just unlocked the LUKs partition, and reformatted it with EXT4

I'm unable to edit (including delete) specific directories on my ext4 filesystem, as it gives me a "structure needs cleaning" error. When I Googled it, most of the cases involved an XFS, not EXT4.

FSCK is telling me that the partition is perfectly fine though.

It's a 100GB EXT4 partition encrypted with LUKS, and contains my home directory (root directory is on another partition and is fine)

Any insight would be very much appreciated, thanks!

I figured out how to fix this issue.

First you need to find files that cause this issue. this is very simple - in ls -l listing they will be shown like

????????? ? ? ? 1.7K Jun  8 13:49 filename
then, you need to run debugfs and delete inode of this file

debugfs -w /dev/sda5
-w says that partition will be opened in read-write mode.

In debugfs prompt you need to type

clri path/to/file
File path should be absolute for this partition. If your partition mounted to /mnt and file you need to delete is /mnt/folder/filename, you should use just folder/filename.

After deleting inodes of all broken files you can leave debugfs and run fsck on partition. It will automatically remove files without inodes and fix your partition.
