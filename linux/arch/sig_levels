SigLevels

SigLevel = Never
No signature checking is performed. This is not recommended as it bypasses all security checks.

SigLevel = Optional
Signature checking is performed if a signature is present. If a package does not have a signature, it will still be installed without any errors. This is useful for local or custom repositories where you may not have signed all packages.

SigLevel = Required
Signature checking is mandatory. If a package does not have a valid signature, the installation will fail. This is the recommended setting for official repositories and for most users, as it ensures that only signed packages are installed.

SigLevel = Package
Only the package itself is checked for a valid signature, but not its dependencies. This can be useful in certain scenarios where you trust the dependencies but want to ensure the main package is signed.

SigLevel = Database
Only the database file is checked for a valid signature. This is less common and typically used in specific situations.
