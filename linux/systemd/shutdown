# shutdown is hanging

## 1. wait at least 5 minutes
	to distinguish a permanent hang from a broken service that's timing out.

## 2. then test whether the system reacts to CTRL+ALT+DEL

## 3. test if the kernel itself is able to reboot or power-off the machine forcedly, with
```
reboot -f
```
or
```
poweroff -f
```

if this doesn't work, it's more likely to be the kernel, not systemd issue.


# shutdown completes eventually

If normal reboot or poweroff work, but take a suspiciously long time, then

## 4. boot with the debug options:
```
systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=kmsg log_buf_len=1M printk.devkmsg=on enforcing=0
```

## 5. create executable debug script
```
sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/debug.sh
```
enter:
```
#!/bin/sh
mount -o remount,rw /
dmesg > /shutdown-log.txt
mount -o remount,ro /
```
make executable
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/debug.sh
```
reboot
```
sudo systemctl reboot
```

## 6. Look for timeouts logged in the resulting file shutdown-log.txt
```
sudo > /shutdown-log.txt
```


# shutdown never finishes

the above method to create the shutdown log will not help
the log must be obtained using other methods
Two options:
## use a serial console
## use a debug shell
